# Hackathon_Rescue_Refugees
The Rescue_Refugees application aims to put refugees from the war in Ukraine in touch with each other by registering their personal information that is entered into the application's database, cross-referencing it with searches made on the side of family members and friends through this personal mapping.  The project was part of a Code Academy event called Hackathon, in which we must in groups of 5 people define, develop and present the concept of an application and its functionalities in an uninterrupted period of 28 hours.  The tools used in JavaBank were Spring, Hibernate, Mockito, Mysql, Junit,Mvc, Javascript, Restcontrollers, Java Script, HTML5, CSS3.
